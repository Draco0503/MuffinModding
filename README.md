# MuffinModding
By Draco0503
## Description
Its a simple mod, developed on [FabricMC](https://github.com/FabricMC) `version 1.19`, that starts a Discord bot who works as a `ChatBridge` with the chat from the Minecraft server and the Discord channel set on `mixin/discord/DiscordMixin.java#44`.

Adding the new Minecraft server commands:

* /discord setBot: Sets up the bot if not.
* /discord start: Starts the bot if not.
* /discord stop: Stops the bot if not.

This mod also includes customizable Minecraft chat messages, see `mixin/discord/ChatMixin.java`. It does not work on Advancement and Non-mod Commands.

Please notify me of any errors or bugs.
